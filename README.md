## This is clearance's portfolio project build up repo.

### Sections
1. **Header section** 
    - Most portfolio websites have headers. The headers normally contain a logo and a some sort of navigation.
      - Clearance, for this section create the header using just HTML, CSS and some DOM manipulation if needed. 
      - Make the header look professional, but also make it capture your style and creativity.
      - Make sure that your header is responsive, I advice that you create it using the mobile first approach.
      - There are tons of portfolio websites you can look at for inspiration online, look at the list below.
